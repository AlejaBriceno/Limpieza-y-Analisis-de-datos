# Analysis of a Telecommunications Company
I analyzed customer behavior and determined that the prepaid plan that generates the most revenue is the Surf plan, because it has more enrolled users and also generates higher additional service charges.

## 🛠️ Technologies used:
Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib

## ✅ Objectives:
-Determine which plan, on average, generates the most revenue

-Describe customer behavior

-Perform a hypothesis test.

## 🔍 Procedure
1. Read the data
2. Data preparation: check for duplicates, missing values, data types, rename columns
3. Data analysis:
     -Find the number of minutes, SMS, and data volume required by users of each plan per month

     -Calculate the mean, variance, and standard deviation

     -Plot histograms to visualize the behavior

## 📊 Results:
The overall conclusion indicates that the plan generating the highest revenue is the Surf plan, first because it has the largest number of subscribed users, and second because it generates more revenue from additional service charges incurred by users.
